# Spaceship Model in Rust

This model has been created using a 3D modeling software called Blender, the challenge of making this model was to use only a cube to start extruding until I had a decent shape of a spaceship. Finally, I exported this model as .obj as a triangulated mesh to be read by the algorithm in Rust.
