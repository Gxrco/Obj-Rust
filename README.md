# Spaceship Model in Rust

This model has been created using a modeling 3D software called Blender, the challenge making this model was using only one cube to start extruding until have a decent shape of a spaceship. Finally, I exported this model as .obj as triangled mesh to be read by the algorithm in 
Rust.
